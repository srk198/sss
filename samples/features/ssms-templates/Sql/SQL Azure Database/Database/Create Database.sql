-- Create database template for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics Database
--
-- This script will only run in the context of the master database. To manage this database in
-- SQL Server Management Studio, either connect to the created database, or connect to master.
--
-- SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service that makes tier-1 capabilities easily accessible
-- for cloud architects and developers by delivering predictable performance, scalability, business
-- continuity, data protection and security, and near-zero administration � all backed by the pow
-- and reach of Microsoft Azure.
--
-- SQL Database is available in the following service tiers: GeneralPurpose, Basic, Standard, Premium , DataWarehouse, Web (Retired)
-- and Business (Retired).
-- General Purpose service tier is a default service tier in Azure SQL Database that is designed for most of the generic workloads.
-- If you need a fully managed database engine with 99.99% SLA with storage latency between 5 and 10 ms that match Azure SQL
-- IaaS in most of the cases, General Purpose tier is the option for you.
-- Standard is the go-to option for getting started with cloud-designed business applications and
-- offers mid-level performance and business continuity features. Performance objectives for Standard
-- deliver predictable per minute transaction rates.
